# -Bresenham-s-Algorithm
Extended Bresenham's Algorithm for slope of line will work with any postive or negative slope
Written in perl tried to make it as short as possible while still being understandable if you know how the algorithm works
it gets the sloap of line using integer arithmetic vs. floating point, so its alot more effecient

Usage: perl filename initial_x initial_y end_x end_y
requires Data::Dumper module
